# We will use the swarm class from the swergio toolbox to simplify the handling of multiple components at once. 
# Of course we can also just start each component one by one by just running the according script.

# The swarm class requires a swarm.yaml file, that contains the specification about each component most importantly the path to each script.
# Once the YAML is defined we run each component at once by instantiating a swarm object and calling the swarm.start() method.

# To start all 20 models we'll just run a for loop and add each model to our swarm and start it. All the models refer to the same file, but are separate processes.

# Let's run a few steps of episodes while training the models via RL and in between perform some evolutions to improve the model pool.
# In this example we will run 20 episodes none deterministic, meaning our actions are sampled and not necessary the best according to our policies.
# Then we can run 1 episode to check how well our models perform after RL training.
# Afterwards we start a evolutionary step and check again the performance of the now new model pool.
